        Hi! I'm Nathan Rissot, a 3rd year CS student @ <a href="https://www.univ-orleans.fr/en/sciences-techniques">Orleans University</a>. 
        I'm currently looking for an internship to gain professional experience and hone my technical skills through real-world 
        problem solving.
            </p>

            EDT Bot (<span title="also known as">a.k.a.</span> trainwreck.py) is a Discord Bot designed
            to provide 3rd year CS students an easier way to access their schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a summer-long project built and maintained in tandem by 
            <a href="https://github.com/danydudiot">Dany Dudiot</a> and me.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used Python w/ the <a href="https://interactions-py.github.io/interactions.py/">Interactions.py</a> library to interact
            with Discord's API, and parsed the .ics files provided by the university to extract, re-format, and filter data based on 
            the user's actual group.

        <p>
            During this assignement, we developed a CLI application in Java following an incremental development principle,
            where each week we had to iterate on what we built based on weekly review, mimicking the SCRUM's sprint system. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While the subject matter was not overly complicated (we only had to code simple games), the constantly evolving criteria
            made it capital to always think forward, as only minimal alteration on what was built previously was allowed, as the objective
            of the assignement was to make us plan out instead of jumping straight into our VSCode to program as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            A concrete example was the way we managed board states and plays in Connect 4, which was a logical choice in Iterations 2 
            when we only had to implement the game to be played by two humans sitting in front of the computer, but became quite an 
            obstacle in Iteration 4 when we had to implement several computer strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learned a lot about iterative development and proper Object-Oriented-Conception, as the choice we made the
            very first week conditioned what we did until the end of the project.

        <p>
            During this assignment, we (<a href="https://github.com/danydudiot">Dany Dudiot</a>, 
            <a href="https://github.com/Tenebiscotta">Agathe Papineau</a> and me) had around a month to develop the website of a 
            mock bank agency following the MVC Design Pattern. The aim of the website was to provide a way for the agency's workers
            to schedule meetings between themselves or with clients, to quickly access client data, and to allow the director to have
            a complete overview of their agency functionnement.
        </p>
        <p>
            My primary task was the CSS and HTML for the site, but we all did a bit of everythin: SQL requests, Vanilla 
            PhP server-side development, a bit of JS for password salting before hashing, but also database schematic drafting and 
            conceptual/technical designing work.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was our first group project, so we also had to learn how to work together, use git and github, solve merge conflicts etc...
